/*
 *  CSC A48 - Winter 2022 - Assignment 1 test driver
 *
 *  (c) 2022 Francisco Estrada
 *  - No part of this code may be reproduced without written authorization
 *
 * This file will test different components of your solution for assignment 1.
 * The actual solution you must implement will be in MDB-c.c.
 *
 * There is no code for you to implement here!
 *
 * Let us say that again:
 *
 * There is NO code for you to implement here as part of the assignment.
 *
 * However:
 *
 * This file contains a sequence of tests that uses the different functions
 * your solution must provide.
 *
 * Have a look at how the tests work, and what is being tested. Think
 * about whether the tests are reasonable, and try to understand why
 * they would be needed to check for functionality.
 *
 * Think also about what additional tests *you should run* to fully
 * convince yourself your code works - As noted in the handout, passing
 * all the tests we provided does *not* guarantee your code is bug free,
 * you have to run your own tests and make sure it is so. You can add
 * your own tests to this file, but we won't look at them when
 * marking your solution.
 *
 * Tests are commented-out initially (because you haven't completed your
 * solution!). Uncomment the tests *as you work on your solution* to
 * test the parts you have completed.
 *
 * Once you have a complete solution, it should pass the entire set of
 * tests below.

    ///  AUTOMATED TESTING SECTION
    ///  HOW TO USE THIS:
    ///
    ///   Once you implement parts of your solution, un-comment the relevant
    ///   tests below, and check your new code passes the corresponding tests.
    ///   Example: When you implement the insertMovieReview() function, you
    ///   should uncomment any tests that apply to insertMovieReview().
    ///
    ///   The ordering of the tests is intended to suggest the order in which
    ///   you should implement and test parts of your solution, but it's up to
    ///   you if you want to do this.
    ///
    ///   Passing all these tests will tell you that your basic solution is
    ///   doing the right thing BUT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE CORRECTNESS
    ///   The testing is not exhaustive, so passing
    ///   all tests here is *not* a guarantee that your code is bug free and
    ///   works under all conditions.
    ///
    ///   ***** You should carry out your own testing and satisfy yourself that the
    ///   soution you implemented is correct ******
    ///
    ///   Finally: Pay attention to how the tests are done, what is being tested,
    ///     what is expected, and how different parts of the test check for
    ///     specific things that must have happened if your solution is correct.
    ///     Doing this will help you develop the ability to write your own
    ///     tests, and will get you closer to being able to fully test code
    ///     by yourself when needed, in a way that lets you be confident your
    ///     programs work as intended.
    
    
    /// NOTE: Trying to uncomment tests below before you implement the required
    ///       CDTs will only cause you to get lots of compiler errors. Only
    ///       uncomment tests for things you've implemented.
